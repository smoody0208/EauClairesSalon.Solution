## MySQL Installation and Setup

* .NET Core 2.2 will need to be installed, it can be found here https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2
* For Mac users, download MySQL here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914
* For Windows users, download MySQL here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919
* Install MySQL and set the system path, more information on how to do that can be found here: https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net/getting-started-with-c/installing-and-configuring-mysql
* Run MySQL by entering `mysql -uroot -pepicodus` in the terminal
* Enter the following commands to create the necessary database and tables:

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `spencer_moody`;
CREATE DATABASE `spencer_moody`;

USE `spencer_moody`;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `clients`;
CREATE TABLE `clients` (
  `ClientId` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `ContactInfo` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `StylistId` int DEFAULT '0',
  PRIMARY KEY (`ClientId`)
